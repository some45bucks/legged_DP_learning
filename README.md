To run go [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cTvQt_X3rsgw5GapY6asvnvTRcvoOsIu?usp=sharing) Select a GPU and then you will need to make sure you copy over the data->go1 so it can build the scene. and make sure everythin from the go1 folder makes it over there there as it should be. then just go to runtime and run all and it should work. It will train a pretty bad model kinda fast just to show it works.

If you figure out how to run it locally it won't shoot out as many warning messsages, but it's not too bad

Let me know ASAP if the collab isn't working
